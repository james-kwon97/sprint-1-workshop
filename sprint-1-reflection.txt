1. How would you describe the command line in plain English in a couple of sentences? Can you think of an analogy for it?

- Another way of accessing any file on my computer without actually clicking on the file with a mouse or track pad.


2. Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?

- I started off at my own pace and my own planned out timelines. Later on I realised that it is better to revise following the timebox guidelines and have been trying my best to follow the original timebox.

3. Name five commands you used and what they do.

    1. cd (change directory) : It can change the current directory folder into any other folder I want access to.

    2. ls (to list files) : I can use 'ls' to list all the files in a folder.

    3. mkdir (make directory) : Mkdir is used to make a new directory folder.

    4. cd .. (going up a layer, out of a folder into the parent) : Can be used to go back out of the current folder.

    5. rm -rf (rm -rf name of folder) : Can be used to delete the certain folder via the terminal.

4. Did you learn anything unexpected?

- Yes, I was surprised you can access folders through the Terminal app and it was something I have never had access to before.
